# Converting git commands to gh commands

I recently discovered Github CLI and realized it is made for github and git is just repositories in generall
so I would like to migrate to github CLI becasue of the shorter commands and better repo management.

Im not saying `GIT` is obsolette, Definitly use wich ever you think is best but I would like to learn to use
github CLI (Wich I will shorten to `gh`)


# Commands

I will edit this on another computer.
just give me a minnute...

| command | other command |
| ------- | ------------- |
| `foo` | bar |
| bar | foo |
