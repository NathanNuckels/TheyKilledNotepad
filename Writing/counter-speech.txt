I was once told that we should not use technology as our friend.
we need to talk to people, but in real life there is no undo.
You make one wrong move and its over. You cant just edit a message or
delete it. But how could such a small mistake have such big concequinces? 
Ill tell ya why. Racisism, heterosexism, anti-furs. "Democrasy is two 
wolves and a sheep deciding whats for dinner." the white people
can drive a minority into the ground if they really want to.
Why would they do that? With all due respect mistrum, why wouldnt they 
so that. People will judge you for whatever stupid crap they want
and fwt away with it. 

Lets say you hate trans people. People cant just "swap over" when ever
they want. Well, they ALWAYS wanted to switch teams from the beginning
my friend, that was tge poan all along; they were born this way!

Lets say you hate furries. What did they ecer do? No, really! 
what did they do to you? Us furries really dont do anything
in thw first place, let alone attempt to physically harm a living person
because why the hell would we do that.

"Furries? But their gay!" OK... WHAT ABOUT IT.

Texhnology trixks us into thinking our voice will ve herd when infact
it is not. nobody listebs to me. i am givibg this speach out here to prove
my point that nobody cates about wgat i gave to say, but i will say it 
anyway. I let my wirds move through my mind lobg enough abd i want
you to hear them. 
Stay Alive |-/
