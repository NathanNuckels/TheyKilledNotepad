[Ryming words are highlited like /this/]
{This means to sing this part faster thn usuall}
| Lines begining with a BAR use normal swing throughout the entire line.

[Spoken]
If I can't go arround and just be /liked/,
Mabee I should never be taking my /time/
If I just have nothing to /lose/ then
I guess I will just be /used/

Ten bucks and I'll draw 
{any furry that's} in your /mind/
Ya know /why?/
becasue my own mind is hard to /find/. I'll

| draw, anything you think of,
| raw on paper, with a fatal
| flaw, of course its hidden in the
| center and I sit and wait for my artistic 
| darkness to enter
| regardless of the time
| know that it will {enter} my mind
| And then my creativity will just be really hard to find.

[High]
What do you know~ about
What do you know~ about
What do you know~ about~ being out.

{This is my} /tulpa/
I need someone to /hold us/
| She's a two foot dragon and likes climbing on my back and-
| Damn it Sushi! Let me go downstairs so I can get myself a snack!

| I can only talk to her when lieing in my bed
| becasue if I am standing up she will not get off of my head
| The {internet} says the pressure's normal but its kinda {driving me mad}
| {But its} good to know what I want and what I really truely always had.

Ho~o~o~o~ooh
