Lets build a day. One, singular, average, american, day.

Check out this block. [A translucent orange cube appears in his hand labled "First Job"]
This block comes in various different sizes,
9 to 5, 6 to 3, It could be anything.
For me personally, I am in high school so the block is 7 to 5.
[The block goes into a perfectly sized slot.]
No matter how hard you pull...
[He pulls on the block, it dosnt move]
Sure it could get smaller or even go away on its own but you can't just pull it out whenever you want.
For that reason, among others, YOU HATE THIS BLOCK!

Heres another one. 
[He holds up a translucent blue block labeled "Second Job"]
Heh, its my favorate color!
Creating artwork [CrizBN ref sheet] or electronics [JtingF's fursuit] or whatever else [BetaEtaDlota live stream]
Its creative stuff. You really like this block. You would rather not do it, but its rewarding nonethelless.
[He puts the block in its slot]

And of course, cant forget about this one!
[He holds up a red block, "Sleep"]
heh...
[He almost puts it in the slot]
[he stops]
Wait...
[Close up of a purple block labled "Relxing"]
I want that... but....
[The camera shows the slots again]
I need... I- uh...
[Close up of his face]
Let me try somthing...
[Blackout]
[There is a loud crash]
AAH!
[fade from black]
[The slot has the blocks "Job 2", "Job 1", and "Relaxing" in that order]
So I kinda... Got it to work...
[Pointing to job 2]
So I do creative stuff at school,
[Pointing to job 1]
And scool at home and [points at "Relaxing"] and then I can finally relax.
[off camera] I think youre missing one...
I uh- well-
[Shows "Sleep" on the floor, shattered like glass.]
[Back to him]
I TRIED MY BEST!! Q~Q
