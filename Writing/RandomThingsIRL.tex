I often mix up my words while recording but this time, was special.
I was suppost to say "There are meany gae crashes caused by codons loading incorrectly" but I
actually said this:

[Dub tones]
ALAN: There are meany game crashes caused by Kobolds.
      [pause]
  KV: Wait...
  KV: WHHHAAAA  HA HA HAAA!
fAUX: "Caused by Kobolds" 'the hell?
  KV: Oh I can't get that image out of my head.
ALAN: A six inch tall dragon with no wings is sitting on a switch controller and the game just breaks lmao
  KV: Yeah. Im sending this to r/Furry
ALAN: Kevin no!
  KV: Sushi would want to see this
ALAN: Ok, I'm drawing that now!
ALAN: [background] I- I-m drawing this!

And I did!
