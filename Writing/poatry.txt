CRYING AT THE CON by Cris Alan

[if you want to put music to this, I'd like that]



GLASS CLOSET by Cris Alan

I am a- 
Oh, not like that!
I DO know my identity
(Took a wile to figure it out though)
I am so closeted I don't even want to say the word.
Im a ????? trapped in a world, 
I think its the wrong world.
Well, a world that- uh- prejudice is-
discrimination is everywhere and I have to-
This poem isn't about lack of words I know what I want to say I just-
Oh I'm just stalling at this point.

Im a closeted furry.
Trapped myself.
in a closet.
so noone can find me

This is not a metaphor
I'm literly crying in a closet.

but its a glass closet.
Everyone can see me anyway.
But as long as my parents dont know all three peices of my identity,
(What I like, Who I like, and lack there of)
I should be safe
from them
I guess
...
[it] Begs the question,
Why hide?
Do they already know?
Would they not care?
No No No!
What if they ask "why?"
What if I cry
or die
And then Void will wake up
and say that she told me so.
What if they wanted grand kids
What if they try to force me back to "normal"
...
F*** your normal there is no normal!
...
Well... At least not while Im arround
Im sorry, self-confedent is the same as entitlement
Im no Karen!

I don't know anymore
I just want to be free 
But I cant.
I must stay in my glass closet
Just read my next poem. I'll explain everything.



WAHT IS THE GLASS CLOSET by Cris Alan

I cannot let anyone see inside.
What I am up to through the night.
All of the poetry and weird stuff I write

But with the door locked so tight
theres no room for delight!
So I must fight
With all my might
Just for some rights
To help free myself of my plight

Although my pain is slight
I am definitly not alright
They out there are impolite
To my fursona, Clyde

All alone, will never unite
cause I'm no socialite

I feel I implied
that I dislike
The fright
thats applied

and I am still trapped in my twilight
Trying to hold back all my spite

'ight?




VOID by Cris Alan

"He always try to stop me 
that Nicholas Borbaki
Hes got no friends close 
but those 
who know him most 
know 
he goes by Nico
He told me I'm a copy
When he'd him mock me
that almost stopped me
well,
Were sourounded, and were hounded
Theres no above
or
a secret door
what are we here for
if not to run through
all our tormentors
but until that time I gotta sing this"

(Morph form the album Trench)


Void, well, her 'sona is
its Vaporeon
ya know the ポケモン [Pokémon]
She speaks 日本語
She wasn't always she
She once was he
but He didnot like Himself
He became Herself
Who would care? Its just a two letter difference.
Well to answer yuor question,
everyone
in a bad way
a bad bad way
Void found salvation
I aint saying where
But she is safe.
Somewhere where mortals can't find her.
My mind.
Void isn't real.
We met in a lucid dream and were friends ever since
She used to be a he named Nebula.
He used to be a Rockruff if you can belive that
But He became she

not anymore
and hopefully never again.

Mabee Void is a metaphor for myself.
Heck, my pronouns arn't even technically words!
Well, Most of them
I guess

Just call me whatever you want.
I dont want you to be mad at me.
You do what you want to do.
I shouldn't have an oppinion.
Im not popular enough

"Lights they blink to me
Trnasmitting things to me
ones and zeros
ergo this symphony
Anybody listening?
Ones and Zeros...
Count to infinity!
Ones and Zeros..."


I UNDERSTAND EXACTICLY by Cris Alan

"Im heavy
My Jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower
I'm higher when I'm heavy
Oh-" (Nico and the Niners from the album Trench by Tyler Josyph)

Music is poatry.
I don't get it
I don't get it at all
but I know that whatever this is refering to,
I have felt this exact emotion
several times before
alone
in the closet
in my "glass closet" of pain


Its ok. Even I forget my pronouns!

Xe, Xir, Xem, Xeir. Xe and its variations are gender neutral pronouns that can be used to refer to people who are non-binary, genderfluid, genderqueer, trans, and/or don't identify with the gender binary. Other variations and tenses of these pronouns include xis, xyr, xyrself and xirself.

I prefer Xyr to xir to make it more different from xeir. Sometimes I use Xis or Xi's instead of Xeir for the possesive. This is unintentionall and I personally prefer Xeir but I guess Xis is technically corect too...

Mine / Gramatically correct

Xe/Xyr/Xem/Xeir




WHO AM I by Cris Alan

I cannot let anyone see inside.            [Xi is trying to hide what xi does]
What I am up to through the night.         [Xi stas up late ]
All of the poetry and weird stuff I write  [Xi addresses xyr writing]
But with the door locked so tight          [Xi is afraid of what people will do to xem]
theres no room for delight!                [Xi locked ximself out of so much bad stuff, xi is locking ximself out of the good stuff too]
So I must fight
With all my might
Just for some rights                       [Xi has been discrininated a lot]
To help free myself of my plight           [Further proving xeir point]
Although my pain is slight
I am definitly not alright                 [Any ammount of pain is bad. "Pain is pain"]
They out there are impolite
To my fursona, Clyde                       [They discriminate agenst xem becasue of their characters]
All alone, will never unite                [Xi does not want to be all alone]
cause I'm no socialite                     [but xi dosn't know how to talk to people]
I feel I implied
that I dislike
The fright
thats applied                              [Xi belives his pain is self evident]
and I am still trapped in my twilight      [Xi is trapped in the dark.]
Trying to hold back all my spite           [Xi wants to fight back but xi dosn't know how so xi just stores up xis spite]
'ight?

No gain
It's kinda insaine                         [Xi is referng to r/AreTHeStraitsOK? (I cant spell it right)]
They should be detained!                   [Xi wants discrimination to be outlawed]
for not letting me explain
all of my pain                             [Xi thinks if xi can explain xeir pain]
Im not playing this game!
Its too tough to tame
the streight                               [straight people have lost all sanity]
poeple who became
insistent on makeing me taint-ed           [Discrimination]
I have just state-d my claim

and Ill do it again

[sigh]                                          [From now on, I'll use Xe instead of Xi. Sorry!]
I have to deal                                  [This line is from "Car Radio" by twenty one piolets. Xe is a big fan]
With what I feel
No way to heal
this feild                                      [Either xe will never be complete or heal might be refering to becomeing streight. In that case,]
of my pain hideing 
inside
the minefeild                                   [xe is saying that xi will always be the way xe is]
of my identity wich I will might never reveal   [xe is closeted]
don't break the seel                            [Dont break the seel of the closet doors. Xe is afraid to be xyrself]
its a courupt deal
not ideal                                       [Society is not ideal and xi will never get over it]

All the people                    [presumibly straight or antifur]
they demand a sequal              [They want to see xeir life continue to the end, nitpicking every part of it]
they say I'm illegal              [Illigal in 70 ish contries! (Verify)]
Theire not like the beagals       [Refering to The Fandom]
and the two tailed weasels        [This line spesifically refers to Buisels, One of xeir favorate Pokemon]
They know my prequal              [They already know all the pain xe has been through]
They like to find me equal        [They treat xem as a human being. As xe shoud be.]
Just like the eagles              [Might be refering to Adler the Eagle]
The seagals                       [Xe wants to be free on the beach. I know its a bit of a streach but It works!]
They too are the townspeople      [Xi claims that people of The Fandom are people too and should be treated as such]

Of a better place                 [Refering to The Fandom]
Possibly space?                   [Xyr fursona is a Protogen and so are a lot of xyr friends.]
I find a faster queer pace        [Queer people walk really fast and he can finally match pace. Literally and metaphorically]
I dig through the database
I find my case
Im ace                            [Xe has found his identity]
My face
Josh Grace.

They, surgals
With the pink fur                 [Might be refering to u/HearterMobs's 'sona's dad. I don't know their name]
So Ive herd                       [Xe discovered it from someone else]
In the MHz   (Mega hurtz)         [MHz is a messure of frequencies, usually radio frequencies.]
You have my word
I wont disturb                    [Xe promises not to interupt Hearter]
Not to alert,                     [but...]
but how are you such an extrovert!?

...I wana be that...              ["Im trans. Not trangender, but im transitioning from being alone to... not... being alone" -Cris Alan]

Im tired!
Im uninspired                     [Xe is running out of things to say]
Youre fired!                      [Xe hates xyr case manager for not helping xem when xe needed it most]
cause I desired
to be an equal
with the poeple                   [Xe wants to be treated like everyone else.]

No more cry
The sun will rize
Ill pretend to be fine            [In the song Semi-Automatic, Tyler states that night time causes a spike of depression. Alan is claiming that there is stll depression during the day, Its just hideing]

Ill wake up in my bed
Mabee well rested mabee well fed   [Xe will pretend to be asleap and hide xeir problems or xe ligitamatly got a good nights sleep]
The morning 'veals its head


remember the future                [These are all lyrics form MESSAGE MAN by twentyonepiolets]
together were loosers
Remeber the morning is when night is dead

RELEASE ME FROM THE PRESENT        [Tyler implies "now" is the worst time, no matter what "now" might mean]
IM OBSESSIN
ALL THESE QUESTIONS
WHY IM IN DENIAL
THAT THEY TRIED THE SUISIDAL
SESSION
PLEASE USE DISGRESSION
WHEN YOURE MESSIN
WITH THE MESSAGE MAN
THESE LYRICS ARNT FOR EVERYONE      [Tyler belives this song only applies to him]
ONLY FEW UNDERSTAND

I understand, Tyler                 [Xe feels his pain. Note: the owner of twentyonepiolets is named Tyler]
As a Protogen I tip my visor        [Xe wants to credit Tyler's music for helping xem express xeir feelings]
Im just a minor
Not a tiger!                        [Xe isn't verry strong... yet! Might also be refering to the song Pet Cheetah]
I feel your power
Im tired
Diggin through code compilers       [Xe is useing code as a metaphor for his friends]
Fixing the program problems         [Xe can solve others problems]
but mine? Ill never solve em.       [But never xeir own]
Absol                               [Aother of xeir favorate Pokemon]
defender                            [Absol warns people of disasters]
The Fur founder's Fender            [The person who created Fur Affinity has the user name Fender]
In the center
Im now a vender
commitions open
Although unspoken                   [Xeir commitions are open but no one ever asks for one]
My token                            [The owner of the discord server Furrily got hacked, spesifically token grabbed.]
Awoken                              [This, for lack of a better term, opend up xeir eyes]
Well, now I'm just heartbroken      [Oh, Well now xe has nobody left!]

[Note, This is a comody sketch]

Pro. 
Noun.

Much better
Its a way of generalizing people
but in a good way
The hes and the hers, the xes and the xers
its his is hers its thers its xeirs
its everyones.
Pronouns are important
You don't want to go around saying
Cris Alan went for a walk,
Cris ALan tripped on a rock.
Cris Alan checked the clock,
Cris Alan picked the lock.
Its too repetitve!
and what if you 
dont want to say the name of the person.
*They* did omthing illigal.
Who did?
THEY!
Whose they?
T H E Y!
How about,
THEY tripped on the stairs.
Whoese they?
Youre not gunna say "I did" youre gunna say
"I mean, my friend just said 'they' I don't know who."
But there is a problem.
Three ENBY people walk into a bar.
They get a drink for them, but they dont drink.
They say "That sentence didn't work"
And then THEY say "Becasue you stole my pronouns!"
And them they say "Screw this im xe/xem now!"
One of them says "Well what will mine be?"
And then they thought of a solution.
They (plural) Walk to a straight male
They (singular) say "Hey! whats your pronouns?"
"uhhhhhh"
"Wow, great pronoun! why didn't I think of that! e/em!"
[pause for croud]
Imagine Uh as a pronoun.
Uh walked the dog
Uh droped Uh wallet
Uh didnt notice.
Uh gave Uh Uhs wallet. Uh found Uh becasue of Uh picture
Uh can't find out why people are calling uh UH!
UUUUUAAAAAAAAAAH!
