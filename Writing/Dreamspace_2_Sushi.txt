{This means go at double speed}
{{This means go at half speed}}
| Lines begining with a BAR use normal swing throughout the entire line.

[Spoken]
If I can't go arround and just be liked,
Mabee I should never be taking my time
If I just have nothing to lose then
I guess I will just be used

Ten bucks and I'll draw 
{any furry that's} in your mind
Ya know why?
becasue my own mind is hard to find. I'll

| draw, anything you think of,
| raw on paper, with a fatal
| flaw, of course its hidden in the
| center and I sit and wait for my artistic 
| {{darkness}} to {enter}
| regardless of the time
| know that it will {enter} my mind
| And then my creativity will just be really hard to find.

[4 bars]

| {This is my} tulpa
| I need someone to hold us
[Time reset]
| She's a two foot dragon and likes climbing on my back and-
| Damn it Sushi! Let me go downstairs so I can get myself a snack!
| {I can} only talk to her when lieing in my bed
| becasue if I am standing up she will not get off of my head
| The {internet} says the pressure's normal but its kinda {driving me mad}
| {But its} good to know what I want and {what I} really truely always had.

Hurrah [2 bars]
Hurrah [2 bars]

| Wake up my little fluffy friend
| Its time to leave and find new ends
| and make them meet
| above my feet
| and save me before I decend
| from you
| you need to find my wonderland
| and then you hop inside our van
| I don't feel like makeing a plan
| {But I guess} you could hang with the band 

[3 bars]
Listen!
[1 bar]

[Reset timing after each line]
I guess its now your turn
I {promice you} won't be burnt
Reply with song or words
I hope you will be heared
I guess its now your turn
I {promice you} won't be burnt
Reply with song or words
Its time for {you to be} heared.

[4 bars]
Ready? Go!

[BGM gets quieter]
[8 bars]

We're goin' home
We're goin' home
We're goin' home
We're goin' home
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
