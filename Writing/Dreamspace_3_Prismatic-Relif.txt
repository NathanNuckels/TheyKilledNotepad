Simaler to DawnFM

Prysms by Alan Grey and Ivan Flores, ft. Tyler Josyph 

I
need
to calm down
I'm inbetween
and will not leave
my-

Light
-ning
Strikes the ground
under my feet
I can't belive

How many secrets can I keep?
Before my time runs out?

[tempo speeds up]

Simaler to Sacrifice
-----
Pardon Alan Grey
You don't judge them for their face or name change
I can't coexist
cause I don't get paied enough for this
Shee needs to let me be me
for a little wile longer
but as long as we are hiding
She is only getting stronger

Lightning strikes way too close to the mirror
I can't wait to get us out of here
Just let me know if she's out of bed
cause I got to get her out of my head!



I want to be free
please
just leve me be
?
?
?

I want to belive
in free will but you make it so difficult
If you decive
then I'll get synical



They will see
Even if they don't want me to be

fighting tention.
 
You don't know my intentions

But I'll tell you




Refracted on glasses
The prisim, it passes
the light of my fight
its the sight of my flight
