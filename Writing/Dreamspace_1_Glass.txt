"This is a cry for help from my future self. Don't tell mom" -computer-cat1

Mid-west Furfest
Feelin' down again     [Refering to post-con-depression]
"Just do your best"     [People tell xem to just do xyr best, and xi always retorts with "But my best is'nt enough"]
But I'm a queer coded villan!

Imagine I am just 
walkin' in the streets     [Xi's just minding xyr own busness]
and then someone asks me
"What does it mean?"     [They could be asking about xyr "Ase Ring" or about this song itself]
(Do you wanna know?)     [Xi could be asking concent, or threttining someone that they arn't ready to handle the truth.]
I look xem in the eyes     [The neopronoun "xem" is Alan refering to Xemself]
and try to say some lies
I'm diying im trying
and lately i've been fine
(Do you wanna know?)

Welcome to my mind     [Xi is hitting them with all the information at once]
An uncencencored library with a bad design     [Xi has no filter when explaining]
Check the door! Swear that I locked it     [Xi is makeing sure no one can see xem]
Nevermind its a glass closet     [Everyone can see xem anyway]
(Glass!)

Oh, they see me and it hurts     [Xi is embarrsed that everyone can see xem]
so get ready for their burns     [Xi knows xi is under attack]
I know they be seein' me but
I'm still secret keepin these-     [Xi's still hiding it even if its hopeless]

[L for THE LIGHT, D for DARKNESS]

D: Don't get me started on breakin' in your teeth
D: Cause I know a lot about comeing out of the heat     ["comeing out" is leaving xyr "glass" closet and "heat" is shame]
D: You don't know what they will do to you              [Xyr dark side says xyr family will throw xem out]
D: You will never know if they're true                  [xyr dark side says that xi can't trust anyone]

L: Arn't you just a macrophile?         [Xyr light side is discrediting xyr dark side by saying they are not as "big" as they claim to be]
L: You reduce buildings to piles        [The light side says the dark side is destructive]
L: How 'bout you just leave right now
L: And go trip over the whole town!

D: I don't want you in denial I just want you safe.                   [1 Most SK people are in denial 2 The dark side is trying to be the good guy]
D: But I don't care what you say becasue you're still a big discrace  [1 A loud minority of SKs trying to de-stigmatise themselves ironicly refer to themselves as "a disgrace" 
                                                                       2 The dark side still hates the light side, and more spesificly, the secret itself. 
                                                                       3 The dark side isn't willing to listen]

L: Replace me     [The light side dosn't want to exist]
D: Oh I will try
L: You took the bait, my mate
L: But I got grace
D: And I don't need a face [Even if "The Darkness" is intangible, it can still affect xem]

L: HEI HEI!     [The JP spelling shows how innocent the light side is]
L: You don't get toxic with me!     [The light side feels entitield to peace]
L: Get the closet! Lock it for me!    [They will acheve peace by hiding and waiting]

D: Its my job to liberate you   [The dark side is just trying to help]
D: But I must manipulate you    [Although the light side wants to come out of the closet, they must be tricked into co-operating with the darkside to do so]

L: Stop pretending I'm a ***! [The light side knows the secret's implications but not how to get rid of them]
D: Do they want to know?
L: [crying] no...   [The light side has no way of destigmatizing Alan]

Welcome to my mind
An uncencencored library with a bad design
Check the door! Swear that I locked it
Nevermind its a glass closet
(Glass!)

Oh, they see me and it hurts
so get ready for their strong words     [Xi already knows how the whole situation will play out]
I know they be seein' me but
I'm still secret keepin these-  [Xi will never stop his meaningless efforts to keep the seccret under controll]

These par~olous fee~lings
