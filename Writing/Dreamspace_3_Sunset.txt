I know the night will fade to grey
but I will force the rain away
The sun comes out; a masterpeice
But then they see the rainbow underneeth

Refracted on glasses
The prisim, it passes
the light of my fight
its the sight of my flight

They will see
Even if they don't want me to be
the one
fighting tention.
 
You don't know my intentions
