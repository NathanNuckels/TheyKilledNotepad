BASEMENT TAPE(S)

This is Criz-Alan's first album, published under the name "computer-cat1" for FurAffinity
in 2017. He first created a song named "Drifter" Then split it in half to FLOATr and DRYFTr.
It is moastly instrumentall with the exeption of Inside and The Basement. The first two
songs put together say "Inside the bacement" wich shows he is hideing somthing but he is trapped
and cannot say it. FLOATr and DRYFTr are hints as to what he is hideing. Tape Decks contains
failed STARBASE recordings and the spelling of "Faux wit hthe Aux" may be refering to one of
his friends, Fxy or could be refering to KURAIO who helps him with his music.

HERE IF YOU NEED ME

This is Criz-Alan's seccond studio album. It is the sucsessor to Basement Tapes.
It all started when Alan said "Mom, you don't love me, you love who you *think* I am"
It promptly started a family fued trying to find his ********* by digging through
his browser history. When she banged on the door when [REDACTED] that tipped him over the edge
and he wrote the song "NO PRIVICY" imeadiatly after. He wrote "Here if you need me" after 
a simmaler incident with the instrumentall track, "Latent Space", soon to follow.

He plans to come out to his familly after christmas 2021 becasue "They will have a valid 
reason to take away presents" but its not all about presents. "Its about love and rights,
how I'll loose them if I reveal what I'm hideing, and the struggle of determining wich one 
is more important."
