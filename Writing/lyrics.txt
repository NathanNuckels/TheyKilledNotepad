Lane Boy

They think this thing is a highway
if it was our way
we'ed have a tempo change every other time change
cause our minds change
of what we think is good
I wasnt raised in the hood
but I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
Wthout all this music I don know how I would have faught this
regardless
all these songs im hearin are so hartless
don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song thats flawless
honest
theres a few songs on this record that feel common
Im in constant confrontation with what I want and whats poppin in the industry
it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
my creativitys only free when I'm playing shows.

Local

Im evil to the core
What I should'nt do I - will
They say I'm emotionall
What I wanna save I'll kill
Is this who I truly am
I truely don't have a chance
Tomarrow I'll keep a beat 
and repeat yesterdays dance

This song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
Its the few, the proud, and the emotionall
Yo, you, bullitpproof in black like a funerall
The world arround us is burning but we are so cold
its the few, the  proud, and the emotionall



Raid

I just wanna stay in the sun where ill find; I know its hard sometimes
Peices of peice in the sun's peice of mind; I know its hard sometimes
Yeah I think about the end just way too much; but its fun to fanticise
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was; but its fun to fantacize- -saiz

"I'd die for you"
thats easy to say
we have a list of people that we would take
a bullet for them
a bullet for you
a bullet for evrybody in this room
but I don't seem to see meny bullets comeing through- see meany bullets comeing through
Metaphorically, I'm the man but literally I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you"
and thats hard to do
Even harder to say when you know its not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back who tried talking to you
But you ignored them still
all these questions there for real
who'd you live for
Who'd you die for
and would you ever kill



Judge
When the leader of the bad guys sang
somthing soft and soaked in pain
I heared the echo from the secret hideaway.
He must'f forgot to close his door
as he cranked out thise dismall chords
and his four walls declared him insaine

I found my way 
right time wrong place
as I plead my case

three lights are lit but the fourth ones out
I can tell cause its a bit darker than the last nights bout
I forgot about the drought of lightbulbes in this house
so I head out, down the route I think is heading south
but I'm not good with directions and I hide begind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections and im best friends wit hmy doubt
and now my mind is out now I hear it clear and loud
Im thinkin "wow I probibly should have stayed inside my house"



doubt

Temperture is droppin' temperture is droppin'
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stoppin
shakeing hands with the dark parts of my thoughts yo
you are all that ive got no
[courus]

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system,
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy isisted,
I want the markings made on my skin,
To mean somthing to me again,
Hope you havn't left with out me
Hop you havn't left without me please



MESSAGE MAN

Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
No no no no no no (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)

A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise,
And who I am today is worse than other times,
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run.
I'm wanted and on the run.
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
No no no no no no (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)

You don't know my brain the way you know my name,
You don't know my heart the way you know my face,
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run.
I'm wanted and on the run.
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

My people singing
My people singing

Hope you're dead
'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this,
People, they rhyme like this,
We're all impressed by this,
They rip it, flip it,
But these are just triplets,
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line,
It's just poetry divided.
I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in music to use it
For others to use it,
You're dead
'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this.

Life is up here, but you comment below,
And the comments will always become common motivation to promote
Your show's next episode,
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope is far from this moment,
But you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head.
Together we're losers,
Remember the future,
Remember the morning is when night is dead.

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

SECRETS THE WEEKND

Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want them too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Wipe the lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'



TANGERINE GLASS ANIMALS

As cold as an old ice cream sandwich
As focused as Mr. Miyagi
You poke at your phone postin' aerial photos
Of you with your smoothie
I can't keep on makin' you happy
'Cause you got issues with your daddy
I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you
And your gran in home movies

But I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?

I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

You let the Devil in
And all you talk is money, money
Money, money, money
It's so funny how it changes how you feel
How you see, how you need, how you sleep
All your freedom, caffeine
How you're lookin' at me
But I love it when the light sits on you just right
Tiny tangerine speckles painted in your eyes

Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

Oh, my God
Drop the beat

You've been dreamlessly sleepin' for years
Super clear since the late 1990s
You only look at me properly now
When you're drunk, watchin' movies
Where are you? What happened?
I want what we had, where you gone? Where you hidin'
It's 2:23, you got Friends on repeat
On repeat, on repeat, on repeat
On repeat, on re-

I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?

I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine


[Im still standing] [author unknown]

You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide
Behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know
I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life
Without you on my mind

I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus
You'd be a clown by now

You know, I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life
Without you on my mind

I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't you know that
I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
But I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life
Without you on my mind

I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Saturday [Scaled and icy][21pl]

Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

Lose my sense a time or two
Weeks feel like days
Medicate in the afternoon
And I just want to know
Have you lost your footing, too?
I just pray that I'm not losing you

Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh

Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

Ooh, you're good
These are my dancin' shoes
We paint the town
Ooh, you're good
Thought I would dance with you
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

(Feelin' great)
Life moves slow on the ocean floor (Feelin' great)
I can't feel the waves anymore
Did the tide forget to move?
I just pray that I'm not losin' you

Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, yeah

[PHONE CALL]
JENNA: Workin' on music?
TYLER: Yeah
JENNA: I, I'll just go to bed, I'm tired
TYLER: I wanna watch "Friends" with you
JENNA: Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired
JENNA: You should just go for it

(Oh) Slow down on Monday (Yeah, yeah)
Not a sound on Wednesday
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(We paint the, on)
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday


Levitate [Trench][21pl]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say

They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough
Yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no we are not just graffiti on a passing train

I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures
I am a vulture who feeds on pain

Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from; please, keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors

Chorus, verse, chorus, verse
Now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too
You're the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help

Welcome to Trench

HERE IF YA NEED ME  -  CRIS-ALAN [Here if you need me]


On my way to MFF
Its the closest and its the best
Linux Daemon running,
It should be quite stunning

but its not.
so-
I'll be in my cave
(alone alone)
I will count my things
(I know, I know)
I want to fight
(I don't I don't)
Im stuck inside-
-My bones, My bones.

I look everywhere for somebody
But I always find noone
I know why your here take a seat.
Because I'll always be here if ya need me
