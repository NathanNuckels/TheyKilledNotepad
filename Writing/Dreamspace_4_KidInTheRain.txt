no sound its out
im out and proud
an outcast now
I sue for peace
they don't release
lightning strikes me
I'm on my leave I-

Drifting through the stars
with a broken heart
?
?
?
?
Thats my waisted time
Imma catch a ride~

They smack, I hack,
Please take be back
They dig me down
and let me drown
I scream, apauled
"I've had it all"
Thye think that my freadoms have sank
but they don't know that I am the kid in the rain
