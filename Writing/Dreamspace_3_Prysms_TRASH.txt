Paridoy of Just Liek Yesterday

Prysms by Alan Grey and Ivan Flores, ft. Tyler Josyph 

-----
I can't sleep
Just takein time off of my feet
with my head instead
is goin hundraid miles a beat
im thinking as Im sinking
and he's winking at me
cause they know the desperation
and temptation is free
Do ya see?
I cant live this way
just to write a song to play
Just to Stay Alive
just enough to breath away
another day another face
and I will loose anthoer race
save me now cause

Tomarrow's gone
Just Like Yesterdaay
-----

I know the night will fade to grey
but I will force the rain away
The sun comes out; a masterpeice
But then they see the rainbow underneeth

Refracted on glasses
The prisim, it passes
the light of my fight
its the sight of my flight

They will see
Even if they don't want me to be

fighting tention.
 
You don't know my intentions

But I'll tell you


discrimination 
elimination
theres an infiltration
goin' into my station

Don't let them get inside my head!
Maybe I'm already dead?
Well, I can't sleep.

You
You don't want me to be 
alone
But you're 
You're bringing in unknown
No!
